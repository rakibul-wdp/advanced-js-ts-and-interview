# What is JavaScript

### High Abstraction

- High abstraction -> less control
- Low abstraction -> more control
- Does not need any resource management and memory allocation.

### Garbage Collected

- It means that we don't need to worry about garbage cleanup. An algorithm inside JavaScript take care of garbage collection and cleaning.

### JIT compiled

- JavaScript is not purely interpreted language, rather modern JavaScript is Just in time compiled.

### Multi-paradigm

- Paradigm: Mindset of code structure which will determine your coding style.
- Procedural Programming
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Functional Programming (FP)

### Prototyped-based

### Functions are first class citizen

- It means that you can throw function anywhere you want. You can treat function as a variable. You can pass function as a parameter of a function. You can return function from inside of another function. This feature gives you a lot of flexibility while using function.

### Dynamically Typed

- You don't need to specify the type of the variable on the declaration.

### Single Threaded

- Single threaded means the execution of instructions happens in a single sequence.
